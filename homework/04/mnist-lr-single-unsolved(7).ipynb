Since we generally assume that the number of examples $|S|$ is fixed, these two forms of the loss differ by a constant factor, so they are pretty much equivalent.\n",

For example, in the MNIST problem, we are distinguishing a single digit from the 9 other digits. On average, there's only a 10% chance each image is our desired digit, so initially maybe we should predict something lower.\n",
    "\n",

Since the length of $\\mathbf{x}_i$ has increased by one, the length of our weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ has also increased by one. Let's call the final entry of our weight vector $w_d$, and call the final entry of our example $x_{i, d}$ (so $x_{i, d} = 1$). Then, when we compute $\\mathbf{w}\\cdot \\mathbf{x}_i$, we get\n",
